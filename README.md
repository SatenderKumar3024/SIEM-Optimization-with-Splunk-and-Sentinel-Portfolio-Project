# 🔐 SIEM Optimization with Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how I, **Satender Kumar**, enhanced advanced persistent threat (APT) detection by optimizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems using **Splunk** and **Microsoft Sentinel**, guided by the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

🔍 **Objective:** Improve real-time threat detection, incident response efficiency, and security visibility across enterprise cloud environments.

## 🚨 Real-Time Alert Simulation

| Alert Type                | Severity | Source   | IP Address     | Detection Time |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Suspicious Login Attempt | High     | Splunk   | 192.168.1.45   | 2 mins ago     |
| Network Anomaly          | Medium   | Sentinel | 10.0.0.123     | 15 mins ago    |
| Malware Execution        | High     | Splunk   | 172.16.0.87    | 32 mins ago    |
| Privilege Escalation     | Medium   | Sentinel | 192.168.5.22   | 1 hour ago     |
